# 📄 Context Coding Workflow

> A 5-step framework for building focused software — from concept to working product, designed for clarity and iteration.

---

## 1. 🧠 Concept  
**Purpose:** Understand what you’re building and why.

- Write a one-sentence product description  
- Identify the core problem or opportunity  
- Define the target user or use case  
- Clarify the value proposition  
- (Optional) Add comparable products or references

---

## 2. 📦 Product Requirements 
**Purpose:** Define what’s essential for the first usable version.

- List only the must-have features (v1 scope)  
- Map out the key user flows (e.g. onboarding, core action)  
- Define what success looks like (outcomes, experience)  
- Clearly state what is **out of scope** for now  
- (Optional) Add simple wireframes or notes

---

## 3. 🎨 App Structure Prototype  
**Purpose:** Create a minimal UI structure to validate flow and layout.

- Build a basic one-page layout with placeholder content  
- Include navigation and major UI sections  
- Use static or mocked data  
- Deploy it immediately (e.g. Vercel, Fly.io)  
- Use this as a visual and interactive reference while building

---

## 4. ⚙️ Technical Requirements  
**Purpose:** Define how the product will be built.

- Choose the tech stack (frontend, backend, infra, tools)  
- Define core data models and their relationships  
- List internal APIs and third-party integrations  
- Initialize the repo, configure environments, set up CI/CD  
- Deploy a working scaffold (layout, routing, live preview)

---

## 5. 🚧 Implementation Plan  
**Purpose:** Organize and execute the build efficiently.

- Break the work into vertical slices (feature = backend → API → UI)  
- Prioritize features based on user value and build order  
- Set short milestones (1–3 days per slice)  
- Test and deploy each slice as it's completed  
- Plan for fast iteration post-MVP (feedback → improve → redeploy)
