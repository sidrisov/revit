# Revit: AI-Powered Feedback Platform

## Overview

Revit is a decentralized feedback application built within the Farcaster social network ecosystem. It leverages AI and cryptocurrency incentives to create a streamlined, high-quality feedback system for creators, developers, and professionals seeking input on their work.

## Summary

Revit is a decentralized feedback platform built on Farcaster that revolutionizes how people request and receive feedback. Users can record audio or write messages to describe their feedback needs, and the platform automatically generates customized questionnaires. Contributors provide structured feedback and earn cryptocurrency rewards, while AI helps curate and score responses to ensure quality. The system guarantees compensation for all contributors while allowing requesters to selectively reward the most valuable feedback, creating a sustainable economy around knowledge sharing and professional development.
